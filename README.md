Readings
This repository will manage the readings of the Content Analysis Course, as well as the responses and discussions to the papers. Each paper to be discussed will be linked as a separate issue in the [issues](https://github.com/UChicago-Computational-Content-Analysis/Readings-Responses/issues) section. Discussions will occur as comments or responses to the issue associated with the relevant paper.
